## Assignment Information

Welcome to the first R assignment. This file is a starter for you to create your slope charts in R.
I include starter code for you to use to download the data.
Use this data and the code files from class to create a slope chart for the percentages in support of marijuana use legalization. 

```{r Package set up and data location}
library(tidyverse)
urlfile="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flynnecon/datavizf25/refs/heads/main/data/assignments/slopeassign.csv"
slopedata <- read_csv(url(urlfile))
```
